Nexpose Universal Crack -ZEN

This is the same basic process I used for every release going back dozens
of versions, always worked fine.

download installer if you don't have it:
windows:  https://download2.rapid7.com/download/InsightVM/Rapid7Setup-Windows64.exe
linux:    https://download2.rapid7.com/download/InsightVM/Rapid7Setup-Linux64.bin

1. install the software, use default locations
2. apply this crack using run it as administrator
   windows: _crack_windows.bat
   linux:   sudo ./_crack_linux.sh
3. in nexpose go to administation section and add the license from file
   r7lic_zeneq_perpetual.lic

There are scripts included to automate the crack:

  a batch file for windows (tested on windows 10 with 16gb ram)
  a bash script for linux (tested on kubuntu 22.04.1 with 16gb ram)

You will need to add the license manually.

If you are having any trouble with this to make very certain you have lots of ram.

Whoever is on the development team at Rapid7 working on this beast, please
consider focusing on chopping this down to be competitive with Nessus.  You could
easily half the size and double the speed of the thing, and have lots of room
to do it again several times.  1.2 gb?? for a program??  Work on the basics!  

enjoy!
