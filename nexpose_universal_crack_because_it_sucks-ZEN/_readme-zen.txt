So really guys Nexpose is just pure garbage.  I just set up and scanned php.testsparker.com and
testphp.vulnweb.com and even though nexpose is a network scanner not a web scanner, it does 
have "full audit" and "penetration test" policies that include a lot of web checks and I just
got back scans that gave absolutely ZERO information whatsoever, anywhere even in the detailed
logs you can download.  It ran nmap with NSE and of course it's own full engine and NO WHERE
in the interface does it tell you even (1) what the server is, (2) what ports are open, 
(3) whats at those ports, (4) any vulnerability.  So, it's just garbage of the highest order.

All that in a gigabyte size download that takes half hour to load and 16gb of ram (in my 
test machine) to actually perform "Well" ... oh hell no, this software is just bottom-tier
trash.  I am embarassed to have released all these crack for it.  Just junk.  I'm taking it
out of my monitoring loop and am going to stop releasing these. It was just free advertising 
for a really junk product that needs to die a silent death and be forgotten.

Actually here is a universal crack that I'd been using to make my releases - should work
going forward until they change their licensing.  Death to Nexpose, it has wasted hours
of my time overall.  Such a waste!
